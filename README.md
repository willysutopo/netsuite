# Netsuite Scripts

Here is the collection of Nestuite related scripts that I will share with you guys. The contents will be kept updated as often as possible. Here are some naming conventions that I am using so that you can easily understand once you read the file names. The file format is like this : filefunction_suitescripttype_suitescriptversion
where
suitescripttype can be one of these :
- sl : suitelet
- ue : user event
- cl : client
- rst : restlet
- sch : scheduler
- mr : map / reduce

and suitescriptversion can be one of v1 and v2.
For example : Suitelet to create Sales Order is named like this : create_so_sl_v1
